------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------Code is in Python Language------------------------------------------------


Please install all libraries mentioned in reuirements.txt file before executing the code 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All files should be in same directory


model_development.ipynb and heart.csv files is not as much important it is used to preprocess the dataset
and to do demo testing and encode the original dataset to train machine learning model so it can be ignored.

Remaining all files accuracy.py, precision.py, recall.py, f1_score.py, Encoded_dataset.csv, Artificial-Bee-Colony_Algorithm.py
and Cuckoo-Search_Algorithm.py file should be in same directory with 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Artificial-Bee-Colony_Algorithm.py file contains code for ABC algorithm which can be executed. By default
it is set to evaluate Accuracy metric of machine learning model which can be changed by uncommenting code for
importing other machine learning performance measures file on top of code but keep in mind to comment out the code
to import other three machine learning performance measure

Cuckoo-Search_Algorithm.py file contains code for Cuckoo Search algorithm which can be executed. By default
it is set to evaluate Accuracy metric of machine learning model which can be changed by uncommenting code for
importing other machine learning performance measures file on top of code but keep in mind to comment out the code
to import other three machine learning performance measure
